    "# Tutorial 1 - Forecasting with AtmoRep\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preamble\n",
    "\n",
    "Training of AtmoRep is a computationally intensive process, typically requiring a couple of weeks on multiple compute nodes of Juwels Booster. \n",
    "However, a selection of pretrained AtmoRep models (singleformers and multiformers) has been made available, enabling immediate use in so called zero-shot applications. <br>\n",
    "Zero-shot applications leverage the intrinsic capabilities of the AtmoRep model and do not require task-specific finetuning or the addition of a specialized network to the core model.\n",
    "In particular, AtmoRep has demonstrated skill for short-range forecasting/nowcasting, temporal interpolation and data decompression. <br>\n",
    "In the following, we will explore the forecast application in a zero-shot setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objectives\n",
    "The objectives of this tutorial comprise\n",
    "- Generation of a six-hour forecast with AtmoRep in inference mode\n",
    "- Handling and plotting AtmoRep's model output\n",
    "- Evaluation AtmoRep's forecast capacities\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "To run the following cells of the Jupyter Notebook, please ensure that you fulfill the following requirements:\n",
    "- Run your JupyterLab on the GPU node of JURECA (use the `dc-gpu`-partition)\n",
    "- Activate your hackathon kernel (see upper right corner of your Jupyter Notebook)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1 - Generate a forecast with AtmoRep\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forecast Inference in AtmoRep\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will demonstrate how to perform a **global forecast** using AtmoRep. The global data is separated into tiles/neighborhoods using a spatiotemporal grids, the illustration bellow shows how a single tile is processed during a forecast. The data is represented across latitude, longitude, and time dimensions. Forecasting involves predicting future tokens (y) within a subset of this grid based on past observations (x). This procedure allows us to evaluate the model's ability to extrapolate patterns and generate meaningful predictions for unseen temporal data.\n",
